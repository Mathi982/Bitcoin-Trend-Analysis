# Bitcoin-Trend-Analysis

This project is focused on analysing the historical trends of Bitcoin prices and making future predictions using linear regression. The data is fetched from the CoinGecko API, offering a detailed look into Bitcoin's price movements over a specified time period. The analysis includes a 30-day simple moving average (SMA) to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.
